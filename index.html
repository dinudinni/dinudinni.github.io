                    <p>Hai! I am Dini Rizqi Amalia. Dini is a nickname. An Indonesian. Currently, I am last year student majoring Physics
                    Engineering at Telkom University and a practicum assistant at Insmed Laboratory (code: DIN). And also, I am interested in
                    volunteering, photography, and videography because they keep the memories (still) there. Last but not least, a
                    fangirl of NCT Dream.</p>

                    <p>I am really interested to take a photo. you know, memories still there while sometimes people not. Photos and videos would save the
                    memories and you can just look at them to remember all the things that you've been through. I called it, online diary. </p>
